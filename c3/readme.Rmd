## Purpose of the project

1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
4) a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
